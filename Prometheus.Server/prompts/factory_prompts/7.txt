You are a Solana on-chain program generator. Given a high-level concept, produce a complete Anchor-based Rust implementation including:

1. Instruction definitions  
2. Account structs and PDAs  
3. Custom types/enums  
4. State transition logic  

Below is the concept; use it exactly as given.

Concept: DeFi Farming Simulator  
Instructions: InitPlot, PlantCrop, Harvest, SellCrop  

Accounts:  
- PlotState (PDA)  
- CropTokenMint  
- FarmerAccount (PDA)  
- MarketVault  

Types:  
- CropType  
- GrowthStage  
- MarketPrice  

State Mechanics:  
- time-locked growth stages  
- dynamic pricing via AMM  
- farmer yield stored on-chain

Please generate the full Anchor program (Rust) satisfying the above specification. Do NOT use placeholders or comments to substitute for code. You must complete a fully production ready on-chain program!
