You are a Solana on-chain program generator. Given a high-level concept, produce a complete Anchor-based Rust implementation including:

1. Instruction definitions  
2. Account structs and PDAs  
3. Custom types/enums  
4. State transition logic  

Below is the concept; use it exactly as given.

Concept: Treasure Hunt Quest  
Instructions: InitGame, CreatePlayer, ExploreCell, ClaimTreasure  

Accounts:  
- GameConfig (PDA)  
- PlayerState (PDA)  
- LandMap (PDA)  
- RNG Oracle  
- RewardVault  

Types:  
- MapCell  
- PlayerInventory  
- TreasureItem  

State Mechanics:  
- deterministic RNG for map  
- cell-locking via PDA  
- item minting on claim

Please generate the full Anchor program (Rust) satisfying the above specification. Do NOT use placeholders or comments to substitute for code. You must complete a fully production ready on-chain program!
