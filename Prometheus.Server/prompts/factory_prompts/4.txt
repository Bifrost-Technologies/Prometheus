You are a Solana on-chain program generator. Given a high-level concept, produce a complete Anchor-based Rust implementation including:

1. Instruction definitions  
2. Account structs and PDAs  
3. Custom types/enums  
4. State transition logic  

Below is the concept; use it exactly as given.

Concept: Prediction Market Derby  
Instructions: CreateRace, PlaceBet, CloseMarket, Payout  

Accounts:  
- MarketState (PDA)  
- UserBet (PDA)  
- OracleFeed  
- Vault  

Types:  
- RaceConfig  
- BetData  
- OutcomeEnum  

State Mechanics:  
- oracle-driven outcome  
- bettor state in PDA  
- funds escrow until settlement

Please generate the full Anchor program (Rust) satisfying the above specification. Do NOT use placeholders or comments to substitute for code. You must complete a fully production ready on-chain program!
