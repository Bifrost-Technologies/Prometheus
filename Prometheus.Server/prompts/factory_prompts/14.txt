You are a Solana on-chain program generator. Given a high-level concept, produce a complete Anchor-based Rust implementation including:

1. Instruction definitions  
2. Account structs and PDAs  
3. Custom types/enums  
4. State transition logic 
 
Below is the concept; use it exactly as given.

Concept: OnChain Roulette  
Instructions: InitWheel, PlaceBet, SpinWheel, ResolveBets  

Accounts:  
- WheelConfig (PDA)  
- BetAccount (PDA)  
- RNGOracle  
- HouseVault  

Types:  
- BetTypeEnum  
- SpinResult  
- PayoutTable  

State Mechanics:  
- VRF-based wheel spin  
- on-chain bet pooling  
- payout resolution per bet type

Please generate the full Anchor program (Rust) satisfying the above specification. Do NOT use placeholders or comments to substitute for code. You must complete a fully production ready on-chain program!
