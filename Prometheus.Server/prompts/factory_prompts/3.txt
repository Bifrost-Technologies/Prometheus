You are a Solana on-chain program generator. Given a high-level concept, produce a complete Anchor-based Rust implementation including:

1. Instruction definitions  
2. Account structs and PDAs  
3. Custom types/enums  
4. State transition logic  

Below is the concept; use it exactly as given.

Concept: NFT Breeder Farm  
Instructions: InitFarm, DepositNFT, BreedNFT, WithdrawOffspring  

Accounts:  
- FarmConfig (PDA)  
- ParentA (PDA)  
- ParentB (PDA)  
- OffspringMint  
- Token Program  

Types:  
- BreedParams  
- NFTTraits  
- CooldownState  

State Mechanics:  
- trait RNG on-chain  
- breeding cooldown per PDA  
- offspring mint authority

Please generate the full Anchor program (Rust) satisfying the above specification. Do NOT use placeholders or comments to substitute for code. You must complete a fully production ready on-chain program!
