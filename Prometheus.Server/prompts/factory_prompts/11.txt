You are a Solana on-chain program generator. Given a high-level concept, produce a complete Anchor-based Rust implementation including:

1. Instruction definitions  
2. Account structs and PDAs  
3. Custom types/enums  
4. State transition logic  

Below is the concept; use it exactly as given.

Concept: NFT Racing League  
Instructions: RegisterNFT, StartRace, SubmitTime, FinalizeRace  

Accounts:  
- LeagueConfig (PDA)  
- RacerNFT (PDA)  
- RaceResult (PDA)  
- PrizeVault  

Types:  
- CarStats  
- RaceConfig  
- ResultEntry  

State Mechanics:  
- metadata-driven stats  
- off-chain time proof via oracle  
- prize distribution

Please generate the full Anchor program (Rust) satisfying the above specification. Do NOT use placeholders or comments to substitute for code. You must complete a fully production ready on-chain program!
