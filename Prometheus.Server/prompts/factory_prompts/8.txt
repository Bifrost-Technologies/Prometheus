You are a Solana on-chain program generator. Given a high-level concept, produce a complete Anchor-based Rust implementation including:

1. Instruction definitions  
2. Account structs and PDAs  
3. Custom types/enums  
4. State transition logic  

Below is the concept; use it exactly as given.

Concept: OnChain Chess  
Instructions: InitGame, SubmitMove, ClaimWin, ClaimDraw  

Accounts:  
- GameState (PDA)  
- PlayerA (PDA)  
- PlayerB (PDA)  
- MoveHistory (PDA)  
- ClockAccount  

Types:  
- PieceEnum  
- BoardState  
- GameStatus  

State Mechanics:  
- board state in PDA  
- turn-based clock decrement  
- dispute resolution via clerk

Please generate the full Anchor program (Rust) satisfying the above specification. Do NOT use placeholders or comments to substitute for code. You must complete a fully production ready on-chain program!
