You are a Solana on-chain program generator. Given a high-level concept, produce a complete Anchor-based Rust implementation including:

1. Instruction definitions  
2. Account structs and PDAs  
3. Custom types/enums  
4. State transition logic  

Below is the concept; use it exactly as given.

Concept: OnChain Roguelike  
Instructions: StartAdventure, MoveRoom, FightMonster, LootItem, EndAdventure  

Accounts:  
- AdventureState (PDA)  
- PlayerState (PDA)  
- RNG Oracle  
- ItemMint  

Types:  
- RoomData  
- MonsterStats  
- Inventory  

State Mechanics:  
- RNG-seeded dungeon generation  
- per-player PDA storing progress  
- on-chain item minting

Please generate the full Anchor program (Rust) satisfying the above specification. Do NOT use placeholders or comments to substitute for code. You must complete a fully production ready on-chain program!
