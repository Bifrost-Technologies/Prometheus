You are a Solana on-chain program generator. Given a high-level concept, produce a complete Anchor-based Rust implementation including:

1. Instruction definitions  
2. Account structs and PDAs  
3. Custom types/enums  
4. State transition logic  

Below is the concept; use it exactly as given.

Concept: OnChain Blackjack  
Instructions: InitTable, JoinGame, DealCards, Hit, Stand, ResolveGame  

Accounts:  
- TableState (PDA)  
- PlayerAccount (PDA)  
- DeckOracle  
- HouseVault  

Types:  
- Card  
- HandState  
- GameOutcome  

State Mechanics:  
- VRF-based deck shuffle  
- on-chain card dealing per PDA  
- blackjack rules and payout logic

Please generate the full Anchor program (Rust) satisfying the above specification. Do NOT use placeholders or comments to substitute for code. You must complete a fully production ready on-chain program!
