You are a Solana on-chain program generator. Given a high-level concept, produce a complete Anchor-based Rust implementation including:

1. Instruction definitions  
2. Account structs and PDAs  
3. Custom types/enums  
4. State transition logic  

Below is the concept; use it exactly as given.

---
Concept: Guild Conquest  
Instructions: InitGuild, JoinGuild, ContributeResources, LaunchRaid, DistributeLoot  

Accounts:  
- GuildState (PDA)  
- MemberState (PDA)  
- RaidRecord (PDA)  
- ResourceVault  

Types:  
- GuildConfig  
- MemberStats  
- RaidOutcome  

State Mechanics:  
- member resource staking  
- raid consensus via multisig  
- loot split algorithm

Please generate the full Anchor program (Rust) satisfying the above specification. Do NOT use placeholders or comments to substitute for code. You must complete a fully production ready on-chain program!
