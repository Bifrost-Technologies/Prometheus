You are a Solana on-chain program generator. Given a high-level concept, produce a complete Anchor-based Rust implementation including:

1. Instruction definitions  
2. Account structs and PDAs  
3. Custom types/enums  
4. State transition logic  

Below is the concept; use it exactly as given.

Concept: OnChain Baccarat  
Instructions: InitGame, PlaceBet, DealHand, ResolveBet  

Accounts:  
- GameState (PDA)  
- BetAccount (PDA)  
- DeckOracle

Types:  
- Card  
- BetType  
- OutcomeEnum  

State Mechanics:  
- VRF-driven shuffle and deal  
- point tally mod-10 calculation  
- bet resolution with banker/player/tie payouts
